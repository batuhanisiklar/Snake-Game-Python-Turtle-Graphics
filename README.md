## 📌 Overview

**My Snake Game** is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game written in **Python** using the built-in **turtle** graphics module. Control the snake with your keyboard, eat the food, grow longer, and try not to hit the walls or yourself!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **Arrow keys** (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to control the snake.
- Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid hitting the walls or colliding with your own tail.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
